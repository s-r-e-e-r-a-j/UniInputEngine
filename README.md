# UniInputEngine

**UniInputEngine** is a **Linux kernel driver** that creates **virtual input devices**, including a **keyboard**, **mouse**, **gamepad**, and **button device**.  
It uses the **Linux input subsystem** to generate input events directly from the **kernel**, allowing software on Linux to receive **synthetic input events** as if they came from **real hardware**.
